## My process




### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript



### What I learned

During this project, the biggest thing I learned was how to use JavaScript to dynamically change the arrow images in the navigation bar from a down arrow (indicating the menu is collapsed) to an up arrow (indicating the menu is expanded). Iâ€™m glad this was part of the project because it's a skill I can definitely apply to future projects.

I also continued to refine my HTML and CSS skills which I love to practice and play around with. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to do simple projects like this to become more intuitive with HTMl and CSS. I also am continuing to learn JavaScript. 

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
